<h1> Global Eletronics Dashboard </h1>
 
<h4>The data was downloaded from the Maven Analytics website under the data playground section.
 <br>
The data consists of 5 different tables with 1 Excel dictionary. </h4>
<ul>
<li> Customers.csv </li>
<li> Exchange_Rates.csv </li>
<li> Products.csv </li>
<li> Sales.csv </li>
<li> Stores.csv </li>
 </ul>
 <h2> Why Did I choose this dataset: </h2>
<p>
 I believe that with a dataset this big I would have to put into practice everything I learned about data cleaning, how to relate tables to each other, and how to construct interesting queries under MySQL.
 <br>
With so much data available I would come up with very interesting insights.
</p>
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>
 <h3>Power BI</h3>
When transforming the date columns I had to explicitly change the format from American to UK otherwise I would be getting errors. <br>
Dealing with price columns I had to remove dollar signs before I could change the column data type to float. <br>
A few tables came with a bad format where the first row was the title for the columns so I used the Power BI option to set the first row as the column header.<br>
Different countries have different formats for their zip codes so I wouldnâ€™t use this column in any visualization so I deleted it.
</p>
 <h3>MySQL</h3>
<p>
After importing the data into a Schema in MySQL Workbench I took notice that column headers had space in their names and this would cause many problems so I went on and replaced every space with an underscore.

<li>Which country is the leading in sales? 
<li>What is the top seller?
<li>How many items in total were sold?
<li>Is gender a relevant parameter for sales?
<li>How to query every piece of information from a specific product?
</ol>
