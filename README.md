<h1> Global Eletronics Dashboard </h1>
 
<h4>The data was downloaded from the Maven Analytics website under the data playground section \n
The data consists of 5 different tables with 1 Excel dictionary </h4>
<ul>
<li> Customers.csv </li>
<li> Exchange_Rates.csv </li>
<li> Products.csv </li>
<li> Sales.csv </li>
<li> Stores.csv </li>
 </ul>
 <h2> Why Did I choose this dataset: </h2>
<h4>I believe that with a dataset this big I would have to put into practice everything I learned about data cleaning, how to relate tables to each other, and how to construct interesting queries under MySQL.M </h4>
With so much data available I would come up with very interesting insights.
